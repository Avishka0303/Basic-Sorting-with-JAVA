# Basic-Sorting-with-JAVA
This includes basic sorting algorithms in java.(With their time complexities)
this inclues most basic sorting algorithms(Mostly for integers.)

<br><br>
1.Insertion Sort
  O(n^2)
<br>

2.Bubble sort
  O(n^2)
<br>

3.merge sort
  O(n log n)
<br>

4.Quick sort
  O(n^2)
<br>

5.Counting Sort
  O(n+k)
   <b>this has been implemeted only for the positive numbers.but it can be modefied for negative numbers either</b>
<br>

6.Radix sort
  O(n*k) <b> if the n is high this is not a suitable sorting algorithm it may higher than the bubble sort.</b>
